# Dirty Data Project

As part of a Data Analysis Course I was asked to complete a 'Dirty Data' Project. Data for four different tasks was presented to me in an untidy format. I was to tidy the data into a useful format in order to carry out analysis to answer questions of interest. Two of these tasks were selected to be documented in a more formal manner. 

The Project was carried out in R studio. All data cleansing was done using using an R script while detailed analysis was done in a R Notebook.

## Highlights

Below are some highlights to give a flavour of the type of analysis that was carried out on each data-set.
